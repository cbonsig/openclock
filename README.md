openclock
=========

A clock designed to resolve the flaws of every annoying alarm clock that I've ever owned. Large display that can be easily read with uncorrected vision, adaptive brightness based on the time of day, intuitive touchscreen interface, clear feedback on the state of the alarm, intelligent alarm audio. Powered by Arduino. A work in progress. Journal of effort to date at http://clock.bonsignore.com
